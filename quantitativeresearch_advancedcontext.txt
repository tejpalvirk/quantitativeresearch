Parameters explained:
1. type: The type of query operation to perform
  - Accepts one of 13 specialized operations: "graph", "search", "nodes", "project", "dataset", "hypothesis", "variables", "statistics", "visualizations", "model", "question", "distribution", or "related"
  - Determines how the params parameter is interpreted
2. params: Operation-specific parameters (structure varies by type):

  - For "statistics": Object containing:
    * projectName: Project name to retrieve statistical results for
    * testType: (Optional) Type of statistical test to filter by
  - For "visualizations": Object containing:
    * projectName: Project name to retrieve visualizations for
    * datasetName: (Optional) Dataset name to filter visualizations by
  - For "model": Object containing:
    * modelName: Name of the model to retrieve performance metrics for
  - For "question": Object containing:

  - For "distribution": Object containing:
    * variableName: Name of the variable to analyze distribution of
    * datasetName: (Optional) Dataset name to contextualize the variable
  - For "related": Object containing:
    * entityName: Name of the entity to find related entities for

Operation details:
- graph: Returns the complete research knowledge graph with all entities and relationships
- search: Performs text-based search across entity names and observations
- nodes: Retrieves detailed information about specific entities by name
- project: Returns comprehensive project information including datasets, hypotheses, tests, and findings
- dataset: Provides detailed dataset analysis with variables, descriptive statistics, and correlations
- hypothesis: Retrieves hypothesis tests and their results for a project or specific hypothesis
- variables: Examines relationships between a variable and other variables (correlations, dependencies)
- statistics: Collects statistical test results for a project, optionally filtered by test type
- visualizations: Returns visualization metadata and descriptions for a project or dataset
- model: Provides detailed model performance metrics, parameters, and validation results
- question: Retrieves research question details, related hypotheses, and supporting findings
- distribution: Analyzes the statistical distribution of a variable with descriptive stats and normality tests
- related: Identifies all entities directly connected to a specific entity

Return information:
- success: Boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded
- Additional fields depend on the operation type:
  * graph: Complete knowledge graph
  * results: For search operations
  * nodes: For specific entity retrieval
  * project/dataset/hypothesis/etc.: For specialized views

You should:
- Start with broad queries ("graph", "search") to explore your research corpus
- Use specific entity queries ("nodes", "project", "dataset") for detailed information
- Examine variable relationships and distributions to understand your data
- Review hypothesis tests and statistical results to evaluate evidence
- Explore model performance metrics to assess predictive accuracy
- Use visualization galleries to communicate research findings
- Examine research questions and their supporting evidence
- Combine multiple operations to build a comprehensive understanding of your research
- Use the related operation to discover connections between entities
- Apply search filters to find specific types of research elements
