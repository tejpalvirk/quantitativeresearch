A powerful tool for retrieving detailed contextual information about quantitative research entities, providing rich statistical insights tailored to each entity type.

When to use this tool:
- Retrieving comprehensive information about research projects, datasets, variables, and statistical elements
- Exploring the statistical relationships between variables
- Examining hypothesis tests and their results
- Reviewing model performance metrics and parameters
- Analyzing dataset properties and descriptive statistics
- Inspecting visualizations related to specific datasets or projects
- Understanding statistical test results and their significance
- Preparing for statistical analysis by establishing data context
- Examining variable distributions and correlations
- Getting a holistic view of quantitative research progress

Key features:
- Provides richly formatted, context-aware information about quantitative research entities
- Adapts output format based on entity type (project, dataset, variable, model, hypothesis, statistical_test)
- Presents both direct entity information and related statistical elements
- Shows statistical metrics, p-values, and significance levels
- Tracks entity views within the current research session
- Formats information in a structured, readable markdown format
- Highlights relationships between variables and statistical tests
- Presents performance metrics for statistical models
- Shows dataset characteristics and variable properties

Parameters explained:
1. entityName: Required - The name of the entity to retrieve context for
  - Example: "Customer Satisfaction Study", "Survey_Dataset", "Age_Variable"
2. entityType: Optional - The type of entity being retrieved
  - Default: "project"
  - Helps the system format the output appropriately
  - Common types include: "project", "dataset", "variable", "model", "hypothesis", "statistical_test"
3. sessionId: Optional - The current session identifier
  - Typically provided by startsession
  - Used for tracking entity views within the session

Each entity type returns specialized context information:
- Project: Shows project status, description, datasets, hypotheses, statistical tests, models, and key visualizations
- Dataset: Displays project affiliation, size, variable count, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and models trained on it
- Variable: Shows data type, role, scale, descriptive statistics, normality tests, and correlations with other variables
- Model: Displays type, training dataset, creation date, performance metrics, and model parameters
- Hypothesis: Shows status, p-value, creation date, associated tests, and project affiliation
- Statistical Test: Shows test type, result, p-value, date, variables analyzed, and hypotheses tested
- Other Entity Types: Shows basic entity information and observations

Return information:
- Formatted markdown text with hierarchical structure
- Sections adapted to the specific entity type
- Related entities shown with their statistical properties
- Error messages if the entity doesn't exist or can't be retrieved

You should:
- Specify the exact entity name for accurate retrieval
- Provide the entity type when possible for optimally formatted results
- Start with project entities to get a high-level overview of research
- Examine dataset context to understand variable relationships
- Review variable context to understand distributions and correlations
- Use hypothesis context to assess research question outcomes
- Explore model context to evaluate predictive performance
- Examine statistical test context to understand analysis results
- After retrieving context, follow up on specific entities of interest
- Use in conjunction with startsession to maintain session tracking
- Remember that this tool only retrieves existing information; use buildcontext to add new entities
