A versatile tool for constructing and enhancing the quantitative research knowledge graph by adding new research elements, relationships, and observations.

When to use this tool:
- Creating new research entities (projects, datasets, variables, hypotheses, statistical tests, etc.)
- Establishing relationships between research elements (e.g., connecting variables to datasets, statistical tests to hypotheses)
- Adding observations, properties, or metadata to existing research entities
- Building the research corpus incrementally as data collection and analysis progress
- Organizing and structuring quantitative data within your research framework
- Documenting statistical analyses, models, and their results
- Tracking research questions and linking them to findings
- Creating visualizations and connecting them to data and analyses

Key features:
- Creates three distinct types of knowledge graph elements: entities, relations, and observations
- Supports 13 specialized quantitative research entity types (projects, datasets, variables, hypotheses, statistical tests, results, analysis scripts, visualizations, models, literature, research questions, findings, participants)
- Validates entity and relation types against predefined standards for the quantitative research domain
- Handles batch creation of multiple entities or relations in a single operation
- Returns confirmation with details of created elements
- Ensures proper data typing and structure for the quantitative research knowledge graph
- Enables comprehensive documentation of statistical analysis processes

Parameters explained:
1. type: The type of creation operation to perform
  - Accepts: "entities", "relations", or "observations"
  - Determines how the data parameter is interpreted
2. data: The content to add to the knowledge graph (structure varies by type):
  - For "entities": An array of objects, each containing:
    * name: Unique identifier for the entity
    * entityType: One of the valid entity types (project, dataset, variable, hypothesis, statisticalTest, result, analysisScript, visualization, model, literature, researchQuestion, finding, participant)
    * observations: Array of strings containing notes or properties about the entity
  - For "relations": An array of objects, each containing:
    * from: Name of the source entity
    * to: Name of the target entity
    * relationType: The type of relationship between entities (e.g., correlates_with, predicts, tests, analyzes, produces, etc.)
  - For "observations": Either a single object or an array of objects, each containing:
    * entityName: Name of the entity to add observations to
    * contents: Array of strings with new observations to add

Valid entity types:
- project: Overall research study
- dataset: Collection of data used for analysis
- variable: Specific measurable attribute in a dataset
- hypothesis: Formal testable statement
- statisticalTest: Analysis method applied to data
- result: Outcome of statistical analysis
- analysisScript: Code used to perform analysis
- visualization: Visual representation of data
- model: Statistical/mathematical model
- literature: Academic sources
- researchQuestion: Formal questions guiding the study
- finding: Results or conclusions
- participant: Research subjects

Valid relation types:
- correlates_with: Statistical correlation between variables
- predicts: Predictive relationship from independent to dependent variable
- tests: Statistical test examines hypothesis
- analyzes: Analysis performed on dataset
- produces: Analysis produces result
- visualizes: Visualization displays data or result
- contains: Hierarchical relationship
- part_of: Entity is part of another entity
- depends_on: Dependency relationship
- supports: Evidence supporting a hypothesis or finding
- contradicts: Evidence contradicting a hypothesis or finding
- derived_from: Entity is derived from another entity
- controls_for: Variable/method controls for confounds
- moderates: Variable moderates a relationship
- mediates: Variable mediates a relationship
- implements: Script implements statistical test/model
- compares: Statistical comparison between groups/variables
- includes: Model includes variables
- validates: Validates a model or result
- cites: References literature

Return information:
- JSON response indicating success or failure
- For successful operations:
  * Success flag set to true
  * Details of created elements in the "created" field (for entities/relations) or "added" field (for observations)
- For failed operations:
  * Success flag set to false
  * Error message describing the issue

Error handling:
- Validates entity types against the predefined list for quantitative research
- Validates relation types against acceptable standards
- Returns descriptive error messages for invalid inputs
- Gracefully handles type mismatches and formatting errors

You should:
- Use consistent naming conventions for entities to facilitate relationships and retrieval
- Begin by creating projects and datasets before more specific research elements
- Add detailed observations to entities to enhance context and retrievability
- Create relationships to build a comprehensive network of interconnected research data
- Document statistical methodology thoroughly by connecting tests, variables, and hypotheses
- Add statistical results with appropriate metadata (p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals)
- Create visualizations and link them to the data they represent
- Use relations to document the flow of analysis from data to findings
- Connect literature to support hypotheses and contextualize findings
- Structure models with clear relationships to the variables they include
- Document analysis scripts with information about their purpose and implementation
