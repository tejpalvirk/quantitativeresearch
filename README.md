- **contradicts**: Evidence contradicting a hypothesis or finding
- **derived_from**: Entity is derived from another entity
- **controls_for**: Variable/method controls for confounds
- **moderates**: Variable moderates a relationship
- **mediates**: Variable mediates a relationship
- **implements**: Script implements statistical test/model
- **compares**: Statistical comparison between groups/variables
- **includes**: Model includes variables
- **validates**: Validates a model or result
- **cites**: References literature

## Available Tools

The Quantitative Researcher MCP Server provides these tools for interacting with research knowledge:

### start_session
Starts a new quantitative research session, generating a unique session ID and displaying current research projects, datasets, models, visualizations, and previous sessions.

### load_context
Loads detailed context for a specific entity (project, dataset, variable, etc.), displaying relevant information based on entity type.

### end_session
Records the results of a research session through a structured, multi-stage process:
1. **summary**: Records session summary, duration, and project focus
2. **datasetUpdates**: Documents updates to datasets during the session
3. **newAnalyses**: Records new statistical analyses performed
4. **newVisualizations**: Tracks new data visualizations created
5. **hypothesisResults**: Documents results of hypothesis testing
6. **modelUpdates**: Records updates to statistical models
7. **projectStatus**: Updates overall project status and observations
8. **assembly**: Final assembly of all session data

### create
Creates new entities, relations, or observations in the knowledge graph:
- **entities**: Add new research entities (projects, datasets, variables, etc.)
- **relations**: Create relationships between entities
- **observations**: Add observations to existing entities

### delete
Removes entities, relations, or observations from the knowledge graph:
- **entities**: Remove research entities
- **relations**: Remove relationships between entities
- **observations**: Remove specific observations from entities

### get
Retrieves information from the knowledge graph:
- **graph**: Get the entire knowledge graph
- **search**: Search for nodes based on query criteria
- **nodes**: Get specific nodes by name
- **related**: Find related entities

## Domain-Specific Functions

The Quantitative Researcher MCP Server includes specialized domain functions for quantitative research:

- **getProjectOverview**: Comprehensive view of a project including research questions, methodology, datasets, variables
- **getDatasetAnalysis**: Analysis of dataset contents including variables, descriptive statistics, and data quality
- **getHypothesisTests**: Review of hypothesis tests and their outcomes
- **getVariableRelationships**: Examine correlations, predictions, and other relationships between variables
- **getStatisticalResults**: Summarize the results of statistical analyses
- **getVisualizationGallery**: View visualizations created for datasets and results
- **getModelPerformance**: Assess performance metrics for statistical models
- **getResearchQuestionResults**: Organize analyses and results by research questions
- **getVariableDistribution**: Examine the distribution and properties of individual variables

## Example Prompts

### Starting a Session
```
Let's start a new quantitative research session for my Climate Impact Study project.
```

### Loading Research Context
```
Load the context for the Climate Impact Study project so I can see the current state of my statistical analyses.
```

### Recording Session Results
```
I've just finished analyzing data for my Climate Impact Study. I ran three new regression models to test the relationship between temperature and crop yield, created two visualizations of the correlation patterns, and confirmed our hypothesis about rainfall effects. The model performance improved by 15% after controlling for regional variations.
```

### Managing Research Knowledge
```
Create a new variable called "Annual Precipitation" that's part of the "Climate Measures" dataset with observations noting it's normally distributed with a mean of 34.5 inches.
```

```
Add an observation to the "Regression Model 3" that it explains 78% of the variance in crop yield when controlling for soil quality.
```
