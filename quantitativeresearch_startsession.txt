Start Session Tool for Quantitative Research

A comprehensive tool for initializing a new quantitative research session, providing structured information about ongoing research projects, datasets, statistical models, and recent research activities.

When to use this tool:
- Beginning a new quantitative analysis session
- Getting oriented to your current research state across multiple projects
- Planning which research elements to focus on in the current session
- Reviewing recent research activities and progress
- Identifying active research projects and their status
- Exploring available datasets for analysis
- Reviewing current research questions
- Examining statistical models and their performance
- Viewing recent visualizations of your data
- Establishing research context before diving into specific analysis tasks
- Re-engaging with your research after time away

Key features:
- Generates a unique session identifier for tracking research activities
- Retrieves and displays recent research sessions with summaries
- Lists active research projects with status information
- Provides a sample of available datasets with key information
- Presents current research questions guiding your studies
- Highlights recent statistical models with performance metrics
- Displays recent visualizations with brief descriptions
- Formats information in an easily scannable format for quick orientation
- Integrates with the loadcontext tool for deeper exploration
- Maintains continuity between research sessions
- Tracks research session history for progress review

Parameters explained:
No parameters required - the tool automatically retrieves all relevant context.

Return information:
- Recent research sessions (up to 3) with:
  - Date
  - Project name
  - Brief summary
  
- Active research projects with:
  - Project name
  - Current status
  
- Available datasets (up to 5) with:
  - Dataset name
  - Type of data
  - Associated project
  
- Research questions (up to 5) with:
  - Question text
  - Associated project
  
- Recent statistical models with:
  - Model name
  - Model type
  - Performance metrics
  
- Recent visualizations with:
  - Visualization name
  - Type (chart, plot, etc.)
  - Associated dataset

Session Workflow:
1. Start a research session with startsession
2. Review the provided context to decide what to focus on
3. Use loadcontext to retrieve detailed information about specific research elements
4. Conduct your analysis, adding new elements with buildcontext as needed
5. End the session with endsession to record your research progress

You should:
- Begin each focused research period with startsession to establish context
- Review recent sessions to maintain continuity in your research
- Identify active projects that require attention
- Note available datasets for potential analysis
- Consider current research questions that need investigation
- Review existing statistical models before creating new ones
- Examine recent visualizations to understand data representation
- Use the session ID when using other tools to maintain session tracking
- After completing a session, record your progress using endsession
- Establish a regular cadence of research sessions to maintain momentum
- Use the structured overview to make deliberate choices about where to focus your analytical effort
